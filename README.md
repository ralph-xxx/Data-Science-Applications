Project Title

Data Science in Education: Student Performance Analytics



Project Objective

This project analyzes student performance data (grades, absences, study time, etc.) to identify dropout risks, improve engagement, and support personalized learning.
Machine learning is applied to predict at-risk students based on their performance patterns.



Key Research Questions

 Which factors most influence student performance?
 Can absenteeism and study habits predict low academic performance?
 How can analytics help schools intervene early?



Dataset Information

Dataset: Student Performance Dataset (Kaggle)
Rows: ~2,400 students
Key Features:
	•	Age
	•	Weekly study time
	•	Absences
	•	GPA
	•	Parental education
	•	Extracurricular activities
	•	Grade class (performance label)

All data is anonymized and used strictly for educational research.




Methodology

Phase                 Description

Data Collection       Kaggle public dataset
Data Cleaning         Handling missing values, converting categorical data
EDA                   Heatmaps, histograms, descriptive statistics
Modeling              Logistic Regression to predict at-risk students
Evaluation            Confusion matrix, accuracy, recall, F1-score
Statistical Tests     t-tests + correlation analysis




Key Insights
	•	Absences negatively affect GPA
	•	Study time has a positive effect on performance
	•	Logistic Regression classified students with high accuracy
	•	Early intervention can be designed for students flagged “at risk”




Performance Metrics

Metric                 Score

Accuracy               ~90%
Recall                 High effectiveness in identifying low performers
F1-Score               Strong balance of precision & recall

Confusion matrix demonstrates correct prediction of most at-risk students.





Technologies Used
	•	Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy)
	•	Scikit-Learn
	•	Matplotlib & Seaborn
	•	Jupyter / Google Colab
	•	GitHub for version control
